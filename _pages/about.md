I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csd.auth.gr/en/) at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and at [Archimedes/Athena RC](https://archimedesai.gr/en/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [George Christodoulou](https://sites.google.com/view/gchristo) and [Alkmini Sgouritsa](https://sites.google.com/site/alkminisgouritsa). I am interested in algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, online learning, and fair division. My research is supported by an Archimedes AI Ph.D. fellowship.
