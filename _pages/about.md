I am an (incoming) Ph.D. student at the the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and [Archimedes/Athena RC](https://archimedesai.gr/en/). I am interested in algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, fair division, and online learning. I am fortunate to be advised by [George Christodoulou](https://sites.google.com/view/gchristo) and [Alkmini Sgouritsa](https://sites.google.com/site/alkminisgouritsa). My research is supported by an Archimedes AI Ph.D. fellowship.
